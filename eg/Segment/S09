These first three strikes were launched in Panama City and its immediate
surrounds on the Pacific Ocean end of the canal.   The wider operations
were the responsibility of Task Force Atlantic, which included naval
forces and troops which had been sent to reinforce Southern Command
earlier in the year.   Their main objective was to seize and hold the
canal itself against the demolition attacks which had long been threatened
by Gen Noriega.

A battalion of the 7th Light Infantry Division and a battalion of the 82nd
Airborne, being used as ground troops, were deployed to seize the Atlantic
Ocean end of the canal at Colon.   They also took command of the crucial

and maintained helicopter and motorised patrols along the 51-mile length
of the canal.

Task Force Atlantic also attacked and seized the main military prison,

Other operations were directed against the small Panamanian Navy of
coastal gunships, and against the airports used by the small air force.
Not seen as a serious military problem, these naval and air assets were
seized mainly to cut off possible escape routes for Gen Noriega and his
supporters.

Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger guerrillas announced yesterday that they had

Several points should be borne in mind when planning your pleats:
<p no=10>
Each curtain of a pair should have the same number of pleats.
<p no=11>
A space of 10cm (4in) to 12cm (4 3/4 in) between the pleats gives an
attractive arrangement, but this is variable in order to arrive at the desired
finished width of curtain.  It is important to remember that the amount of
fabric left unpleated (i.e., the total of all the spaces) must equal the
length of your track (plus returns and overlap arm where applicable).
<p no=12>
Where the curtains are to cover returns, locate one pleat at each end of the
curtain fixture and leave a flat space at the outside edge of the curtain to
cover the return.
<p no=13>
When curtains are to butt together, plan to have a half space at each leading
edge.  When using an overlap arm, leave enough space to correspond to the size
of the fitment.  One complete space on each curtain is sufficient.
<p no=14>
Finally, do not let the following calculations and precise measurements deter
you.  It is possible to juggle the pleating and spacing arrangements within
reason, putting more or less fabric into the pleats and spaces to achieve your
desired result.
<p no=15>
To calculate the pleats-and-spacing arrangement, work on the basis of one
curtain.  When dealing with a pair, divide the track length in half and use
this measurement when referring to track length.

Next we restrict ourselves to harmonic ( optical) fields E(t), with

In 1991, British government finances again moved into deficit and the
projections are that the deficit will grow but notwithstanding this the
market in UK government bonds will remain, by international standards, a
medium-sized one for the foreseeable future.
<p no=26>
But if in recent years the market in British government bonds has declined
in size, the market for other sterling bonds has grown.   The exchange
controls which had been strictly enforced for over forty years were
removed in 1979 and this enabled both sovereign and corporate borrowers
from abroad to issue sterling-denominated bonds in London.   And as
nominal rates of interest declined from the high levels of the 1970s and
early 1980s, there was also an increasing number of British companies
seeking bond finance.
<p no=27>
Sterling bonds, other than those of the UK government, may be issued in
one of two distinct ways.   The traditional way involves a public offer
for sale with a published prospectus and listing on the London Stock
Exchange; distribution tends to be mainly to investors resident in the
United Kingdom.   
<p no=28>
The alternative way is by means of an issue of sterling eurobonds where no
prospectus is issued and where the bonds are distributed through banks and
security dealers to an international investor clientele; sterling
eurobonds may be listed on the London Stock Exchange but need not be.
Issuing bonds in the form of eurobonds has a number of advantages
(discussed below) and this method of issue has now become the dominant
one.

Single-mode instabilities in high-finesse resonators are particularly
simple because the propagation and time-delay effects can be reduced,
using a first-order Taylor expansion, to a simple first-order differential
equation for the mode amplitude, as will be described in the next section.
<p no=30>
Note that the cavity feedback involves a finite time delay, of order **f
in certain circumstances this enables the Maxwell-Bloch equations
(required to relate E (L, t + L/c) to E (0, t)) plus cavity boundary
conditions, to be expressed as a discrete mapping in steps of tR- this has
been extensively studied in the context of passive resonators, and will be
elaborated below.
<p no=31>
Practical resonators share most of the properties of this ideal
unidirectional ring resonator, but with complicating features.   One of
these is the transverse mode structure.   The ideal resonator, with plane,
and necessarily finite, mirrors, actually supports an infinity of
transverse mode structures, of varying complexity in amplitude and phase,
transverse to the resonator axis.   This introduces undesirable extra
degrees of freedom into the system,  which can, however, often be
suppressed by an appropriate choice of mirror curvature and aperture,
assisted in some cases by wave-guiding properties of the medium itself.
<p no=32>
A ring laser has a further degeneracy: each longitudinal mode frequency
supports a pair of counterpropagating modes, which will ordinarily have
the same threshold, and thus both be excited.   To suppress one of these,
and produce a unidirectional laser, it is necessary to employ a
nonreciprocal element usually based on the Faraday effect - which makes
the cavity more lossy for one of these modes than the other.
<p no=33>
This last degeneracy does not occur in a Fabry-Perot resonator, in which
the light bounces between parallel mirrors.   This is by far the commonest
cavity for lasers in general, but has major drawbacks from a theoretical
standpoint: the standing-wave pattern greatly complicates the atomic
response and can also lead to multimode operation, and time and space are
much more intimately mixed in the feedback process.   None the less,
Fabry-Perot experiments seem to give rise to broadly the same sorts of
instability as those predicted from ring cavity analyses.

We are also planning to help tackle the question of portrayal by
establishing a database of all contributors to News and Current Affairs.
Most programmes run such a contact list at present.   But by pooling them
we can find out whether women are fairly represented.   In those areas
where they are not, we will seek out people to put on the database.
<p no=35>
Once this is established we will then begin monitoring the portrayal of
women on our programmes.
<p no=36>
We are actively trying to improve the number of women and members of the
ethnic communities who are reporters and presenters.   Anna Ford has often
said that she believed that a woman should have had a role on our Election
Night programmes.   I hope that next time we will have a woman in a major
role.
<p no=37>
We are also trying to make News and Current Affairs a better place to work
by providing more flexible ways of working.   We already encourage
job-shares, part-time working and career breaks and we are introducing
home working.   And we are encouraging managers to be sympathetic to the
sudden disruption of working hours that can be caused to a parent of
either sex responsible for children.   To back this up we provide
subsidised nurseries and a dependent care allowance to those whose hours
change at short notice.   We are also looking at the possibility of
introducing emergency childcare but financial assistance for this is
taxable.
<p no=38>
We need to move away from the idea that "they" - women, people from ethnic
minorities and the disabled - are a problem.   This is not proving easy.
<p no=39>
For example, a belief in a more consensual empowering style of management,
consulting staff on policy as well as day-to-day issues, being receptive
to ideas, requires courage.   Some, used to a more old-fashioned top down
managerial style are cynical about such an approach.
<p no=40>
We need a change in culture.   We've got to recognise that many women in
our organisation, for example, perceive a glass ceiling.   Whatever we say
we believe in, is not being enacted in practice.   There is no easy answer
but I believe that we can make the environment we work in fairer to women;
to all minority groups.   It will only happen if we all treat it as a
priority.

Table 3.1 shows the number and value of UK government bonds (gilt-edged)
outstanding at end September 1991.   Over 100 stocks were listed with a
total nominal value of just under GBP125 billion and a market value
slightly in excess of this.   
<p no=42>
At the same date, the market value of all company securities listed on the
International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of
Ireland was almost GBP1,970 billion.  At end December 1990, the size of
the international bond market was estimated by the Bank for International
Settlements to be $1,472.5 billion (GBP763.15 billion).
<p no=43>
Table 3.1 UK government bonds outstanding 30 September, 1991  The nominal
value of government stock outstanding changes continually due to a number
of factors of which the most important are redemptions and conversions of
existing stocks, the issue of new stock, and the annual
inflation-adjustment to the nominal value of index-linked stock.   
<p no=44>
Over time, the dominant influence on the nominal size of the government
bond market will be the public authorities' need to borrow and the means
by which this need is met.  In Britain, borrowing needs of all public
authorities are largely centralised and expressed as a public-sector
borrowing requirement (PSBR).  
<p no=45>
Apart from the years 1988-90 when the PSBR was negative  (i.e. a
public-sector financial surplus), this borrowing requirement has been met
by sales of marketable debt (principally bonds) and of non-marketable debt
(principally savings certificates and deposits with the national savings
bank).

To conclude this section, we can, at last, refer to an experiment.   As
noted, the rate equations (7.4) are stable, but the standard technique of
modulating one of the parameters, for example y, extends the phase space
sufficiently to allow chaotic behaviour.   This has been achieved in a CO2
laser {;5};.  Bistability - the coexistence of stable oscillations at
either one-third or one-quarter of the modulation frequency - was
observed.   
<p no=47>
Increasing the modulation depth, the two attractors become strange.   A
particularly interesting feature of the results was the appearance of a
low-frequency divergence of the spectrum when the two attractors become
strange.   The authors attributed this to low-frequency jumping between
the two attractors, and suggested that such behaviour may lie at the root
of the puzzling low-frequency noise spectra displayed in many nonlinear
physical  systems - systems as diverse as electrical resistors, biological
membranes and automobile traffic flow.
<p no=48>
With the honourable exception of this last case, the homogeneously
broadened laser has so far proved a fertile field for instability and
chaos only for the theorist.   In contrast, when the laser is
inhomogeneously broadened, the experiments were for long in advance of the
theory, as we shall see below.
<p no=49>
First, however, we examine passive resonators, which are perhaps the
simplest of all optical systems, and indeed, in one limit, reduce to a
one-dimensional noninvertible map, and thus possess a period-doubling
route to chaos.
<p no=50>
Passive nonlinear resonator theory, described by equations (7.5) with C> 0
and thus y 0, was originally developed in the context of optical
bistability(OB): I x in the state equation (7.6) can clearly be a
multivalued function of y, which corresponds to an optical device that can
have two or more transmission states for a single-input field, and can
thus act as an optical memory device (Fig. 7.2).

First-hand reporting is a critical duty.   It was not just economic
weakness that led to the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.   It was
also the availability of free information on radio and television, in
particular.   Good independent journalism underpins a free, democratic
society.   Fast, accurate information is the lifeblood of the economy, of
politics, and of society in a way never seen before.   Good journalism can
also expose wrongdoing, evil and corruption.   Good journalism can also
stimulate change or action from politicians and from society at large.
We can all recall instances of that - whether it be the famines in
Ethiopia or the prison camps in Bosnia.
<p no=53>
The underpinning of all good journalism is a devotion to objectivity and
impartiality.   That means a positive spirit of enquiry.   Journalists
with no axe to grind, no message to put across, no prejudice to bear,
positively seeking after the truth.   It's an invigorating concept because
it involves going out and searching for new stories, new voices, new
views, the articulate in the community as well as those who have no voice.
It involves questioning and challenging and testing all views - those that
represent the status quo- as well as those clamouring for change.
<p no=54>
To do all this all broadcast journalists must have the opportunity - the
outlets - they must have the resources, the money, the infrastructure, and
the equipment.   And there must be the willingness to give professional
journalists the confidence to tackle the sort of journalism we need to
sustain our democracy.

Table 3.2 Net official sales of UK government bonds 1981-1991  As can be
seen from Table 3.1, just over one-tenth of the nominal value of
outstanding government bonds is now in the form of index-linked stocks.
The value of these stocks is uprated each year in line with changes in the
retail price index.   For other stocks ( conventional stocks), the nominal
value is fixed in terms of pounds sterling and hence all such stocks
decline in real value due to price inflation.   
<p no=56>
During the 1980s, inflation in Britain measured by the retail price index
averaged around 6 per cent per annum; a rate sufficient to halve the real
value of a fixed sum of money in twelve years.   Conventional stocks and

Table 3.3 provides figures for turnover in British government securities
for the years 1985-1991.   Prior to the reform of the market in October
1986 (see below) all transactions were on behalf of customers but
subsequently there has been much trading between market makers as well as
transactions with customers as the table shows.
<p no=58>
Table 3.3 Turnover in British government securities 1985-1991  Since the
reform, the number of bargains per day has averaged nearly 3,300 with the
average size of bargain reaching nearly GBP1 1/2 m in 1990.   From a
longer-term perspective, it can be said that the number of transactions
per day has shown no tendency to increase since the mid-1970s; there was a
surge in total number of transactions during 1987 and 1988 due to a large
number of deals between the newly established market makers but both
transactions on behalf of customers and intra-market business has fallen
back since then.   
<p no=59>
On the other hand, the average value per transaction has risen steeply
since the early 1980s; this reflects both the increasing size of
transactions with customers and the fact that modern intra-market business
is typically conducted through deals of high value ( over GBP4m on average
in 1991).

The other factor on which the architects of Tayif have been counting is
divisions within the Christian community.  President Bush himself, no less,

It is not the general who must go, his aides say, it is Tayif which must

not for interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.

It is, on the face of it, a very considerable offer.  But it is very doubtful

The situation in an inhomogeneously broadened medium is quite different.
The dominant mode saturates effectively only those atoms whose
(Doppler-shifted) resonance frequency lies within about I" of the mode
frequency: other atoms are unsaturated, so that the gain actually
increases with frequency detuning from the dominant mode: the excited mode
burns a hole in the gain spectrum.   
<p no=79>
Careful design is thus necessary to restrict laser action to a single
mode.   Even then, however, an instability can arise due to
"mode-splitting".   
<p no=80>
As well as the spectral hole burned in the gain, the refractive index
contribution of the resonant atoms is also saturated, again over a
spectral width -I".   
<p no=81>
As a result, the dispersion relation close to the operating frequency
develops a "wiggle", which, for strong enough saturation, may turn into a
5 shape.  When this happens, we have three frequencies which all share the
same wave vector, and are thus resonant with the cavity.  
<p no=82>
Since the spectral hole ensures that the two new sideband frequencies
actually have higher gain than the central ( originating) frequency, they
will grow: self-pulsing develops.   This phenomenon was termed
"mode-splitting" by Casperson and Yariv {;12};.   The pulsation period

I understand the fears, worries and concerns of those who have launched
the Save Radio 4 on Long Wave campaign.   Radio 4 is a very precious asset
of the BBC.   Even a change in its schedule brings controversy.   A little
while ago, its Controller, Michael Green, moved Woman's Hour from 2
o'clock in the afternoon to 10.30 in the morning.   An enormous public
storm ensued - both internally and externally.   But he stuck to his guns.
And the audience for Woman's Hour is now larger than it was.

We've gone back and looked at the correspondence we've had about the News

concern since the network was announced.   Since the campaign was launched
on "Feedback", the BBC has received thirty-nine critical calls.   Compare
that to one day recently when there were more than seventy calls about a
schedule change.
<p no=90>
Of course we take all of these worries seriously- but I want you to get
the scale of the complaints in perspective.
<p no=91>
Now if you read what is written about this change you'd think the BBC was
about to axe Radio 4.   Nothing could be further from the truth.   All the
main news and current affairs programmes from Today through to the
Midnight News will be on both frequencies.   And the BBC's engineers are
working flat out to ensure that the reception of Radio 4 on FM - is the
same as for Radio 1, Radio 2 and Radio 3 - that's over 98% of the UK.
The engineers are also looking at the possibility of transmission by
satellite for Europe and remote parts of the UK.
<p no=92>
There are clear signs that the BBC will not be allowed to go on
simulcasting.   That's why you can no longer get Radio 2 or Radio 3 on
medium wave.   We've not been told yet - but we do n't believe it will be
possible to simulcast Radio 4 on long wave and FM beyond the mid-nineties.
So a News Network gives us a chance to extend CHOICE for all our

fabric with right sides facing and bottom raw edges level.  Pin, tack, then
machine along the seamline 1.5cm ( 5/8 in) in from raw edge.  Trim seam
allowance to 5mm ( 1/4 in).  Turn right side out and press the hemline.

Lay the blind out flat with lining uppermost.  Make sure the lining is lying
perfectly flat and smooth against blind fabric and square to it.  Then pin the
lining to the outer fabric across the full width of the blind, starting 3.5cm
(1 3/8 in) up from the bottom edge to form the lower channel at the base of
the blind.  Then pin the lining to the blind as close as possible to each
stitching line forming the channels, across the full blind width.  Tack, then
machine in place, ensuring that the stitching lines are perfectly horizontal
and parallel to each other, and make sure you have not caught any of the
channel fabric in the stitching.  Pin the sides of the lining to the blind,
excluding the ends of the channels, then slipstitch (fig 53).

Turn 1.5cm ( 5/8 in) of blind fabric and lining to the wrong side along the
top edge.  Pin, tack then machine the soft side of touch-and-close fastener
over the raw edges.

Insert a lath into each channel, then slipstitch the ends together.  Stitch
two rings to each channel, except the bottom one, approximately 10cm (4in) in
from the sides.
