The fighting had just broken out in Panama City when a group of men
dressed in civilian clothes and armed with rifles surrounded the Marriott
Hotel and began rounding up guests. 
<p no=1>
For the next 4 1/2  hours the men held us hostage, told us about their
comrades who had already fallen in battle, and threatened to kill us. 
<p no=2>
"A lot of Panamanians have died and we can kill you," one of them told New

I had just checked into the hotel and come down to the sunken terrace when
I saw armed men running in a crouched position by the swimming pool.
About the same time I heard gunfire.   It was about midnight (5am GMT) and
the US assault had started.

I made for the hotel's main building with several other reporters when a
man with an assault rifle appeared and said: "Hit the floor." He herded us
into the lobby, which was full of people.

The gunmen took people's passports and they searched my bag.   About a
dozen men took charge of me and 11 other foreigners.   I never saw more
than 20 armed men in the hotel.   They told us they had surrounded the
building.

"We're being invaded, so we're taking hostages," said one, who appeared to
be their leader.

They did not threaten me personally, but they made it clear that they
could kill us all.   There were about eight US citizens in our group.

The armed men eventually let me retrieve my bag and notebook - my money
had been taken - and remain in the lobby.

Task Force Bayonet launched its platoon of light tanks and its companies
of armoured personnel carriers against the HQ of the Panamanian Defence
Forces (PDF).   Some of the heaviest fighting took place here, and
witnesses reported severe damage to some of the civilian areas in the
tight-packed streets around the headquarters.   Most of the civilian
casualties were incurred here.
<p no=10>
Defended by well-armed troops, the US assault forces had to use heavy
weapons, including anti-tank rockets and mortars, to blast their way into
the building, which was largely destroyed in the fighting and the fires.
<p no=11>
TF Bayonet was also charged with protection of US bases and sent two
assault companies of helicopter-borne troops from the 87th Infantry to
block the PDF base at Fort Amador.   The 5th company of the PDF,
apparently surprised by the American move, slowly organised a

They were dropped around the Rio Jara base, where two Panamanian companies
were "neutralised" by a parachute battalion of 600 US Rangers.   Some of
the Panamanians managed to escape with their weapons and spasmodic
fighting continued in the area yesterday.   A second battalion, dropped
onto the International Airport, was also charged with neutralising the
elite Battalion 2000, the most formidable of the Panamanian forces.

Such a trial, however, could well prove to be a double-edged sword for the
administration, since the general once boasted that he possessed
information that would prove highly embarrassing to President Bush.   That
claim may have been sheer bravado, but given his long association with US
intelligence, the general undoubtedly has enough mud to splatter many of
his erstwhile US friends.

Of all the dictators the US has befriended and turned against, Gen Noriega
has proven the most resilient and ruthless - partly out of necessity.
One Colombian drug boss, upon hearing in 1987 that Gen Noriega was
negotiating with the US to abandon his command for a comfortable exile,
sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name.
<p no=16>
The US knew the kind of man it was dealing with.   In 1960, when Gen
Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a
spy-in-training for the US Defence Intelligence Agency, he was detained
for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute. 
<p no=17>
He became a formal CIA asset in 1966 or 1967.   He rose to chief of
intelligence in Panama's G-2 in 1970 after providing the populist
dictator, General Omar Torrijos, the support to defeat a coup.  Gen
Noriega, however, soon started freelancing for Cuban, Israeli, and
Taiwanese intelligence services.

"Early on in the State Department, we took to calling him the

Affairs.

The Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Miklos Nemeth, quit the leadership of the
ruling Socialist Party yesterday amid bitter disagreement over his
economic policies and the pace of the country's transition to a market
economy. 
<p no=20>
Mr Nemeth, a strong adherent of neo-monetarist measures to resolve the
country's fiscal crisis, accused his party colleagues of failing to
support him as head of government and claimed his resignation was guided
by national rather than party interest. 
<p no=21>
In his letter of resignation to the party leader, Mr Rezsoe Nyers, with
whom he has been waging a long-running feud, Mr Nemeth stated he had no
option but to resign.   But there was no indication that his tenure of the
premiership would be threatened by the decision.

"The praesidium decided not to support the 1990 budget and the party is

<p no=23>
Despite the party leadership's opposition to aspects of Mr Nemeth's
austerity measures, the budget is expected to be approved today, after
parliament successfully watered down the controversial changes in housing
policy which entailed steep rent rises and a sharp increase in mortgage

Outrage and concern at the violence in Romania during
the weekend came from all parts of the world yesterday, with the Soviet
Union and the US in the lead. 
<p no=26>
The White House said the repression was "totally unjustified" and that the
US would consult its allies on a co-ordinated response. 
<p no=27>
European foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels, condemned " in the

forces. 
<p no=28>
The Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, was foremost among
those who deplored the violence.   Questioned as he left Nato headquarters
in Brussels, he said "if indeed some loss of life has occurred, I can only
express my very profound regret".   The Soviet Union was categorically
opposed to the use of force, he added. 
<p no=29>
The Soviet news agency, Tass, was also explicit about developments in
Romania, stating that "tension was high" inside Timisoara.   It reported

There was no official comment from China which has had close relations

Solidarity's leader, Mr Lech Walesa, said: "We demand respect for the

The latest phase in Panama's crisis began last Friday, when General
Noriega had himself declared formal head of government by his
self-appointed National Assembly, and simultaneously announced that a
"state of war" now existed with the US.
<p no=33>
Gen Noriega's apparently gratuitous escalation of the crisis played into
American hands, allowing President Bush to claim a strong degree of
bipartisan support from Congress.   The "state of war" declaration clouded
what might otherwise have been a clear-cut case of American aggression and
gave the White House the makings of a case under international law. 
<p no=34>
But it is not clear whether the military operation which unfolded
yesterday could have been organised in only four days.   Gen Noriega's
provocations may simply have accelerated a plan that had been ready to be
unleashed at any time. 
<p no=35>
The day after the declaration, which did not seem at first to be being
taken seriously in Washington, Gen Noriega's troops escalated the crisis
into a confrontation.

While the Tigers are finally embracing democracy, violence seems certain
to continue in the north and east.   The guerrillas are embroiled in a
civil war against an alliance of rival Tamil groups, the Tamil National
Army, in areas from which the Indian Peace-keeping Force has withdrawn. 
<p no=38>
The Tigers say they will not contest elections until there is peace.   The
Indians, who they fought for nearly two years, must also complete their
pullout. 
<p no=39>
As well, the Tigers' chief political adviser, Mr Anton Balasingham, said
the guerrillas would not contest elections until the government drops a
constitutional amendment requiring election candidates to swear an oath of
allegiance to a unitary state. 
<p no=40>
This is bound to create suspicions among the majority Sinhalese community
that the Tigers still harbour ambitions of their own Tamil state.   The
new party is also dedicated to "fighting for the right of
self-determination of the Tamils and Muslims" and "protecting and
preserving the geographical identity and integrity of the traditional
homelands of the Tamils and Muslims". 
<p no=41>
But Mr Balasingham stressed that "self-determination" was different from
separatism.   "It is like a husband and wife," he said.   "If they can
live harmoniously and happily together, they will remain united.   If the
relationship becomes intolerable, the parties will have the right to
divorce.   By self-determination we mean the right for us to associate and
integrate with the unitary state, or, as a nation, to secede."

Fixing into wood is the easiest method, therefore fitting to the window frame
should not present any problem provided the depth of the frame is deep enough
to take the track brackets.  Make pilot holes, then insert screws.
<p no=43>
Positions 2 and 3 could be the most difficult if there is a concrete lintel
above the window, as this will involve drilling into concrete.  In this
instance, it may be easier to fit a batten into the actual concrete, which
will require fewer holes.  The track or pole could then be screwed into the
batten.
<p no=44>
Higher above the window there may be brickwork, in which case a batten may
again be the easiest method to use.  Its only disadvantage is that it will
project the curtain fixture further into the room and when the curtains are
open the batten will be visible.  The resulting space from the end of the
track or pole back to the wall is known as the "return" and can look rather
unattractive unless covered with fabric.  Attach a screw-eye into the end of
the batten near to the wall into which the end curtain hook can be slotted.
<p no=45>
When fixing into the ceiling, you should ensure that you screw directly into
the joists.  If these are not in the right position for your track, you can
make fixings with special plasterboard plugs, but you should then avoid
hanging heavy curtains.
<p no=46>
In modern timber-frame houses, it is possible that you could be fixing into
the timber frame itself and/or plasterboard above the window reveal.  In this
case, screws fixed into the timber will be quite satisfactory, but
plasterboard plugs (cavity fix) should be used in between.

Finally, tracks and poles will benefit from regular attention as dust and dirt

The ousting of General Noriega is likely to make it easier for the US to
live up to its commitments under the Panama Canal treaties agreed by
President Carter and then Panamanian strongman, Omar Torrijos. 
<p no=49>
Signed in 1977, the treaties ended unilateral US control in 1979.   All US
operational rights over the canal will terminate by the year 2000. 
<p no=50>
But rightwing members of Congress have never reconciled themselves to the
return of the canal to the Panamanians.   Figures such as the Florida
senator, Connie Mack, saw the Noriega affair as a golden opportunity to
make the 1977 canal treaties void.   By toppling Gen Noriega, President
Bush has deprived rightwing resentment of a focus. 
<p no=51>
"I am fully committed to implement the Panama Canal treaties and turn over
the canal to Panama in the year 2000...   As soon as the new government
recommends a qualified candidate, Panamanian, to be administrator of the
canal, as called for in the treaties, I will submit this nominee to the
senate for expedited consideration," Mr Bush said yesterday. 
<p no=52>
Now that Gen Noriega is gone, senate approval of the administrator is
likely to be much less of a problem. 
<p no=53>
The history of US policy towards Panama is inextricably tied to its canal.
President Roosevelt first contacted Colombia to get rights to build a
canal through the isthmus of Panama, which was then within its boundaries. 
<p no=54>
When the democratically-elected Colombian senate rejected Mr Roosevelt's
proposal because the money offered was too low, he sponsored an invasion
instead.   Thus Panama gained its independence from Colombia and the Canal
Zone was born. 
<p no=55>
Since then, with the exception of the period beginning with Torrijos
coming to power in 1969 and the Noriega years, the US controlled not only
the Canal Zone itself, but Panamanian politics as well.

"The party apologises to the working people, artists, the intelligentsia

"The party wishes to become the joint guarantor of our rights to a free

As a signal of its goodwill - reluctantly agreed to by some members, but a

The militia was much in evidence last January during a week of

A 1903 treaty between the US and Panama gave the US the right to build and
open a waterway.   The US also received the right to govern an area of
land called the Panama Canal Zone on both sides of the canal.

The arrangement eventually became a sore point in relations between the US
and Panama, which regarded the original treaty as an affront to its

to Panamanian control in 1979.   The canal itself will be handed back to
Panama on December 31, 1999.

A second and less well-known treaty gives the US the right to defend the

The US maintains that it supports the OAS charter, that it is acting to

But there is clearly a newly assertive policy being followed in the White

Prior to making any curtains or blinds, make sure you are properly equipped.
There is nothing more irritating than to start a job, and find halfway through
that you do not have a vital piece of equipment.
<p no=98>
Your most important piece of equipment will be a sewing-machine , and you
should of course know exactly how it works.  Ensure, too, that you always have
a selection of spare needles ranging from fine to heavy (70-100).  You should
change your needle regularly, and not only when it is blunt or broken.
Different fabrics require different thread and size of needle.  Always
practise on a sample of fabric first to find the right combination.  One of
the most common reasons for a machine not stitching correctly is using a blunt
needle or an incorrect size of needle for the fabric and thread.  A large pair
of cutting scissors are essential.  They should be kept in a sharp condition,
otherwise they will be no use at all.  Bent-handled shears are best of all, as
the blades rest flat on the cutting surface.  A small pair of scissors , about
15cm (6in) long are useful for trimming or unpicking.  Embroidery scissors are
excellent for this as they have pointed blades.  A seam ripper is useful, but
should be used with caution to avoid cutting fabric.
<p no=99>
Pinking shears are not essential but can be useful.  They cut a zig-zag
edge to prevent fraying.  Never use these scissors to cut paper as this will
blunt them.  An iron , preferably a steam one, will be needed.  The base of
the iron should be kept clean.  A pressing cloth prevents fabrics from
becoming shiny.  A well-padded ironing-board is necessary, but when ironing
big curtains, a large flat surface is more suitable, softened with several
layers of cloth.  A metal tape-measure of a good length is essential for
measuring your window.  A good quality tape-measure that will not stretch is
necessary for general sewing use.  It should have both metric and imperial
markings.  A padded weight is useful, approximately 15cm (6in) square by 5cm
(2in) deep, to hold fabric firmly in position and prevent it slipping.  To
make one, fill a cardboard box with sand or other heavy material.  Seal the
box with tape, then pad and cover it, attaching a handle across the top.
<p no=100>
Tailor's chalk is needed for marking the fabric.
<p no=101>
Pins Sharp dressmaker's or glass-headed pins are best.  Never use rusty
pins as they will mark the fabric.  Have a selection of hand-sewing needles to
hand, in assorted sizes (1 coarsest - 10 finest).
<p no=102>
Thread .  Cotton thread is available in different deniers: 50 for
lightweight fabric, and 40 for medium to heavyweight.  Synthetic thread is
very strong and should be used with synthetic or stretch fabric as it has more
elasticity.  It is essential to use the correct thread to obtain perfect
stitching.
