Joan rode home, her heart heavy as lead.   She was beset by the
realization that she desired nothing more than to go to the Hall as Anne
Mowbray's companion.   At the same time, she felt a sense of guilt, of
disloyalty, that she could even for an instant contemplate the idea of
deserting her mother and turning her back on the place she called home.
<p no=7>
She took no pleasure from the countryside as on the outward journey.
Then she had shown an avid interest in everything she saw: the horses
themselves, the rabbits frolicking in the fields or running to escape the
horses' hooves, in a landscape full of promise - cool, mellow and green.
Now the sun had disappeared behind a cloud and the countryside was
shadowed and brooding - an unfriendly place filled with menace.
<p no=8>
Her heart was still at Framlingham Hall, the house that stood in the
shadow of the great castle with thirteen towers, built by Roger Bigod in
the year 1177.
<p no=9>
Briar Cottage looked of a sudden smaller, Joan thought as it came into
sight.   It appeared deserted, a trifle sinister even amid the overhanging
trees - and, though she had not before registered the fact, it lacked the
sound of happy voices which had in times past always greeted her return.
Briar Cottage no longer seemed like home; like the cottage where eleven
years earlier she had been born.

The groom helped her dismount and she thanked him politely and waited,

It was dark.  Nobody saw the accident.  The small white car was found on
its side by the bridge.  A river ran underneath the road there, and the
car was lying next to the bridge wall, below the road.  Inside the car was
a dead woman.  Her name was Karen Silkwood and she was twenty-eight years
old.  It was November 13th, 1974.
<p no=12>
How did the car come off the road?  Why was it on the wrong side of the

car.  Karen Silkwood was a good driver.  Everybody knew that.

How did the car come off the road?

The police thought that there was an easy answer to these questions.
Karen was tired after a long day, so she fell asleep while she was

garage and they took Karen's body to a hospital.

Curtain hardware has come a long way since the days of the narrow brass rod
and rings.  There is now a large range of fixtures and fittings from which to
choose.  It is of paramount importance that you select a type that will take
the weight of your curtains; after all, the main purpose of tracks and poles
is to act as a means of support.  You will also want to choose a type that
will suit your special needs, for example, you may require it to bend round a
bay, and you will need to consider whether a pre-corded version is necessary.
(Corded fitments enable curtains to be drawn without handling or soiling the
fabric.)  In addition you will need to decide whether you want a type that
will act as a further embellishment of your scheme or one that blends
insignificantly into the background in order not to detract attention from the
curtains themselves.  Finally, remember when buying your curtain fixture to
allow extra length to enable your curtains to be drawn back beyond the sides
of the window, where possible.
<p no=16>
Tracks are made from either plastic, aluminium, steel or brass, and in general
those made of metal are stronger.  They can be coated with a white, gold,
silver or brass finish, either plain or decorative.  Some can be fitted with
finials, most can be fitted into the wall or ceiling and are usually bought
complete with all the necessary fixtures and fittings.  A selection is shown
in fig. 1.
<p no=17>
There are several plastic tracks available, varying in strength, which are
suitable for straight runs and which can also be bent successfully round bays.
Some have gliders which slot into grooves on the back of the track.  Others
have all-in-one hook gliders which clip onto the face of the track and
eliminate the use of separate curtain hooks.  These hook gliders also have a
small hole in their base which is positioned below the track from which a
separate lining can be hung.  Optional cording sets with overlap arm are
available which enable the curtains to overlap at the centre when closed.
However, these sets are mainly for use on straight runs.
<p no=18>
Tracks which are cut to measure are essential for the more awkward fitting
situations.  These strong steel tracks can be cut to length by a supplier,
pre-bent to fit an awkward bay, and have the additional advantage of being
ready corded.

The story of Karen and her brown envelope began in 1972 when she took a
new job at a nuclear factory in Oklahoma.  Before that, she worked as a
secretary, but in 1972 she was really tired of a secretary's life.  She
looked in the newspaper and saw that there was a job at the nuclear
factory.
<p no=20>
The pay was much better than a secretary's pay, and the work was more
interesting.  She went to see Mr Bailey, the manager of the factory, and
she was surprised and happy when he gave her the job immediately.  He
asked Karen to start work the next day.
<p no=21>
On her first day at the factory Karen learnt a lot.  Mr Bailey told her
that she had to wear a special white coat, some special shoes and a white
hat.
<p no=22>
"These clothes protect you from radioactive dust," he said.  "There is n't
really any danger, of course.  Everything is safe here.  We check
everything all the time."
<p no=23>
At first Karen liked her new job.  She was an ordinary, small town girl
who liked ordinary things: a comfortable home, a glass of beer, an evening
with good friends.  Soon she had some new friends from the factory.
<p no=24>
She also liked Drew.  He worked in another part of the factory, but
everyone used the same coffee bar.  She met him a few days after she
started the job.  In the coffee bar she and Susan were laughing together
at a story in the newspaper.  Then Karen suddenly heard a voice behind
her.

Steel telescopic or extendible tracks are a good investment because of their
adaptable length, making fitting easier, but they are suitable only for
straight runs.
<p no=26>
The conventional " I" shaped track made of brass with wheeled runners and
rings is now also available in a lightweight plastic version.  The former is
more suitable for use with heavyweight curtains, but the latter will operate
more silently.  These tracks can be fitted round bays with the optional use of
a cording set, and can be fitted with a valance rail.
<p no=27>
Although tracks are now less unsightly, you may still feel they need to be
covered with a pelmet or valance.  A decorative pole could be the alternative;
there is a tremendous range from which to choose, but they are all only
suitable for straight runs.
<p no=28>
Wooden poles suit an informal, unsophisticated atmosphere, and the untreated
type could be painted or stained to suit your decor.  They are generally made
of a hardwood called ramin with a natural, mahogany or walnut finish, and are
available in lengths up to 300cm (10ft) with diameters of 25, 30 and 35mm (
1in, 1 1/2 in, 1 3/8 in).  They are generally supplied with deep projecting
wall brackets, up to 88mm (3 1/2 in), which makes them ideal for placing over
radiators or projecting window sills.  However, with some varieties it is
possible to buy short-reach brackets or recess brackets, if preferred.  On
wide spans it is essential to use enough support brackets to prevent the pole
from bending under the weight of the curtains.

My father picked up the Book of Remembering.   He read, " In the beginning
there were millions of planets in the Galaxy but there was only life on
one.   That was the planet Earth.   People and animals lived together.
But people polluted Earth.   It became too hot for animals to live.  They
died.   All the animals died.   So people left Earth and never returned to
that planet.   Their hearts were empty when they left Earth, empty today,

Once Bess Halidon had been laid to rest in the small village churchyard,
and the initial shock of her mother's death had abated, Joan decided to
pay a second visit to Framlingham Hall.   Should the dowager-duchess not
be in residence, she told herself, she would leave a message with the
housekeeper.
<p no=37>
Elizabeth Mowbray having been informed by a servant of Bess Halidon's
demise, had sent Joan a formal but kindly letter of condolence.   She had
made no reference to Joan's first visit to the Hall, considering it
unsuitable to combine such a letter with practicalities.
<p no=38>
Presenting herself at the servant's entrance, Joan asked nervously if she
might speak to the housekeeper.   After a few minutes, she was shown into
that estimable if forbidding woman's presence.
<p no=39>
"You wished to see me, I believe," Mistress Bubwith said coldly.   She was
uncertain as to the position of this girl whom she knew to be daughter to
a washerwoman but whom the dowager-duchess, a lady of formal demeanour and
rigid etiquette, none the less treated as one of higher status.
<p no=40>
There is more in this than meets the eye! thought the housekeeper.   The
girl is polite enough, though somewhat raw in speech - yet her likeness to
the lady Anne is quite uncanny.   It is plain that someone, sometime, bore
an infant on the wrong side of the blanket!   The lady Anne is a Mowbray
all right, so 't is plain from which side of the family this lass comes.
That being so, I must watch my step and keep my ears pinned back.

"I'm here to see Her Grace," explained Joan, having  rehearsed what she

"What is the nature of your business with Her Grace?" enquired the
housekeeper coldly.

"It has to do with what was said last time I was here."

"Her Grace is at home.   Wait here and I will enquire as to an
appointment."

Mistress Bubwith returned very quickly, seeming a mite breathless.

IT may never be known whether the Syrian army ever really did intend to seize
Baabda Palace, drive out General Michel Aoun, and install the new President,
Elias Hrawi, in his place.
<p no=48>
But if it did, it was apparently to have been a big affair - no mere
helicopter-borne "surgical strike" - in which sheer weight of numbers and
firepower could have been expected to guarantee ultimate success.
<p no=49>
Very heavy Syrian casualties would apparently have been deemed a lesser price
to pay than the probable failure of anything less than what the general's men
say was planned: a full-scale armoured and infantry assault involving 40,000
men on five main axes along a 50-kilometre front.

The likelihood that, after all the fanfare and ultimatums, it is not going to

Nothing ever happens on Just Like Home - that's the name of the planet I

But tonight was Remembering Night and that's exciting.   There's the big

<p no=54>
But what I like best about Remembering Night are the clothes.   We usually
wear what we like on Just Like Home - but the clothes must have the name
of our name-animal on them.   For example, I always have the word
"Hummingbird" on my clothes, which means my name is Hummingbird - Hummy
for short.
<p no=55>
Nobody knows what a hummingbird looks like, but we know what birds are.
Birds are animals that fly.   The Book of Remembering tells us that.
<p no=56>
I do n't always believe what the Book of Remembering says.
<p no=57>
Nobody knows who you are on Remembering Night because you wear black

It was dark outside.   The only light came from the big fire.   I held my

"It is indeed, Joan - and keep it you shall," smiled Elizabeth Mowbray.
"Whilst you remain here with us - and let me say here and now that there

the life of the household and have all provided.   Furthermore, it would
please me to give you an allowance for your personal use."

"Your Grace, I do n't understand - why are you doing all this for me?  Has
it to do with what you said as you'd tell me one day?"

"In some measure - but only in some measure," replied Elizabeth Mowbray.
She looked down at a letter on the table in front of her, collecting her
thoughts.   Is not this lass sister, half-sister to my daughter? she asked
herself.   What else, since she is of my lord's begetting?   "I see you as

The animal began to play.   It tried to bite its tail and fell over its

were round it in a circle, laughing and playing with it, just like the
humans in the Star Zoo.
<p no=75>
I watched them.  This was very important.   These children had n't learnt
to be afraid of animals because they had never heard of Earth, the
Burning, or the Book of Remembering.

I watched and thought.   I spoke softly to my robot: " If these children

animals.   They wo n't go crazy." I thought some more, and said, "But if
their parents see the animal, the parents  will  go crazy."
<p no=77>
I thought carefully.   Yes, there must be a special room in every house.
A room which parents could n't go in.  A room for children only.   Then
children could play with robot animals in that room.

"That's it!" I said.   "The children will still be happy to be with

"Yes, that's right," Karen answered.   "I have a photograph here in one of

and someone has drawn eyes, a nose, and a mouth on it.   And look, there's
a pin in the doll's stomach.   A few days later the man came to hospital
because his stomach hurt.   He knew that someone was using voodoo against
him.   The pain was terrible, but the doctors could n't find anything
wrong with him.   In the end, he died."

Conway was surprised.  "So you think that was magic because there was no
reason for it," he said.   "But you're a doctor, are n't you?   You do n't

"Voodoo is more than magic.   I do n't believe in magic, but I know that
voodoo can be very dangerous.   I want to understand how it works.   Here
in Haiti there are still a few people who know how to use voodoo.   They
are called "houngans".   There are still a few"houngans" in the villages
in the country.   And that's why I'm here.   I want to meet some of them
and talk to them.   Of course they are n't all bad people.   They can use
voodoo to help people, like doctors.   But they can use it to hurt people
too."
<p no=83>
"But we're living in the modern world!"
<p no=84>
"Yes, but the people here are very sure that voodoo is real.   Teachers,
business people, doctors, everyone believes in it... or they are afraid of
it.   And perhaps that's why it works.   After all, if you believe you are
ill, you can be ill.   And if you really think you're getting better, you
can get better.   If you think that someone is trying to kill you, then
you can die... because you are so afraid."

"Well, that's a good story," laughed Conway.   "If I need some voodoo,
I'll come and see you."

When Captain Pugwash retires from active piracy he is amazed and delighted
to be offered a Huge Reward for what seems to be a simple task.   Little

Sinkport, or what a hideous fate may await him there.

It was business as usual in the ancient seafaring town of Sinkport.
There were the usual minor excitements: a murder in the churchyard, a few
muggings in the back-streets and alleys, and the election of a new Mayor
with all the bribery and corruption which accompanied such an event.   But
the citizens of Sinkport were far too busy with fishing, boat-building,
buying and selling and making money out of the tourists to take much
notice of such happenings.

So the arrival at the Grand Quay of that famous pirate ship the "Black

For Captain Pugwash it was, he hoped, the end of a long and infamous

home from the Caribbean Sea, he was seeking a comfortable spot in which to
retire, and Sinkport, with water all around its ancient houses and its
church crowning the hill, seemed as good a place as any.   His crew too
were happy at the thought of leaving the sea.  They had always found
buccaneering terribly alarming, and felt seasick at the slightest sign of

Tom, "is Mutton House, the grandest dwelling in the town.   Over there,
beyond the church, is Witchball Street.   That's where my Aunt Clarabel
lives.   She runs the Jolly Jailor Inn." "I hope it's more comfortable
than  that  place!" remarked Captain Pugwash, pointing to a dark fortified
building further on.

They walked on through the graveyard, and Kee said, " My grandfather is
here in this graveyard.   He was my mother's father.   I remember the day
when he died.   I cried for a long time when I saw that big dark hole in
the ground, and we put his body in the grave.   It was raining.   I was
twelve years old.   My mother and father were with me, and they were
crying too.
<p no=117>
"I'm sorry," said Karen.
<p no=118>
"Oh, it was a long time ago," said Kee.   "But my grandfather's grave was
the last on this hill.   After he died, they made a new graveyard on the
other side of the village.  That's why nobody comes here now.   Nobody
remembers the old people here."
<p no=119>
"But you do."
<p no=120>
"Oh, yes.   I could never forget my grandfather.   He taught me about
voodoo, about the spirit of the rain and the spirit of the wind.   You
see, nothing is really dead.   There's a spirit in everything, in every
tree, in the sun, in the sea.   If you understand voodoo, you can talk to
these spirits.   And there's a spirit under this cold grey stone.
<p no=121>
Kee showed her the stone on his grandfather's grave and Karen read the
words slowly.   "Tim Atty.   Born 1845.   Died 1906." Kee looked at Karen
and said quietly, "Some people say he was the strongest houngan of all,
the houngan we call Baron Samedi."
<p no=122>
"Baron Samedi!" cried Karen.   "Your grandfather!" Suddenly she felt
afraid when she heard the terrible name.   She looked at the old man.
<p no=123>
"I see you know more about voodoo than I thought," he said.   "But do n't
be afraid of me.  I'm just an old man who does n't like the new world." He
smiled at Karen again

Soon the Mayor was shaking the Captain by the hand.   "I am honoured
indeed, Sir," he said unctuously.   "Coffee for the gentlemen please Mr
Slipshod."
<p no=125>
"I happened to observe you reading that notice below and it does seem to
me that this challenging task might well be of interest to you.   These
smugglers, it appears, are led by a retired buccaneer, "Jake" somebody or
other... "
<p no=126>
"He's a villainous fellow with an eye-patch and a great black beard...
Why, whatever is the matter, Captain?" For Pugwash had turned deathly pale
and seemed about to faint.
<p no=127>
"Pray let me reassure you," went on the Mayor hastily, " There would be no
danger  to you personally in this affair.   The actual arrests would be
made by Colonel Bodge and his excellent Dragoons.   All you would have to
do would be to lead them to the smugglers' rendezvous and supervise the
action."
<p no=128>
"And the Huge Reward?" asked the Captain, hastily recovering his
composure.
<p no=129>
"It would be yours entirely," replied the Mayor.   "Mr Slipshod here has
all the details.   The rest is up to you.   Au revoir, and good luck!"
<p no=130>
"It is like this," said the Town Clerk as they left the Town Hall
together, "This arch-smuggler,  Cut-throat  Jake they call him, is
apparently planning to receive a load of contraband liquor this very
evening, at dusk, by the rocks below the Baddie's Tower.   Merely lead the
Dragoons to the spot and the Reward is yours."

Kee turned and went to the door.   For a moment, as the old man was
walking out of the door, Conway remembered the face in the book on the
plane.   Suddenly he felt cold and afraid.
<p no=132>
When Kee left the room Conway picked up the  telephone.   He talked to
Marie.   He was very, very angry.
<p no=133>
"Marie!" he shouted.   "Why did you send that man to my office?   He's
mad.   Coming in here talking about voodoo!   Telling me he's going to
give me a lot of money!   I do n't want to see him again.  Do you
understand?  If you make a mistake like that again, you'll lose your job."
<p no=134>
"I'm very sorry," said Marie.
<p no=135>
"Good.   Now, I want to talk to Pierre and Henri.   Get them on the
telephone for me." He put down the telephone and sat back in his chair.
"That man Kee is  mad," he thought.   Then he started to laugh.   "He
thinks he can give me everything I want!" he thought.   "An old man from a
village!   Ha, ha, ha!"
<p no=136>
The telephone rang again.   Conway picked it up.   "Pierre, Henri,
listen," he said.   "A few minutes ago an old man came to my office.   He
does n't want any shops or houses in the graveyard.   It's possible he'll
try to stop us.   I do n't know what he can do, but perhaps he'll go to
the police.   Perhaps he has important friends.   So you must start
building the shops and the hotel today.   Take away all the stones.   Cut
down all the trees.   You must work fast, do you understand?"
<p no=137>
Conway put down the telephone and thought, "The old man will be angry, but
he is n't important.  I'll finish building my town and then I'll be a rich
man.
